                    APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island. His father Jainulabudeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque. By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
